# Power BI Report - Sales of a pharmaceutical company

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of sample data of a multinational pharmaceutical company's performance over a year across five European countries: the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Germany. The study is encapsulated in a multi-page Power BI report, meticulously designed to provide insights into the company's operations through KPIs.

The first page serves as an executive summary, providing a snapshot of the company's product sales and profit. It also includes a comparative analysis of actual sales versus targets for each product to gauge the company's performance against its strategic and operational goals.

The second page delves deeper into the company's operations across different countries. It provides visualizations that allow for an easy comparison of performance metrics across these markets. This detailed breakdown helps in identifying market-specific trends and opportunities.
